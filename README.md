### Movie Information
Each movie has extra information about the movie when clicked, allowing you to make a more informed decision before nomination!

### Save Nominations
Ever accidentally leave a page to go get snacks and lose all your progress? Not on this site! Your results are automatically saved for whenever you want to return to nominating your favourite picks!

### Animations
To allow for a better user experience, the website has many clean animations for deleting/adding a nomination, loading movies, and buffering when querying for your movie selection!
